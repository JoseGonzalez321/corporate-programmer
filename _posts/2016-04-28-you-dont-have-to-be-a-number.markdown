When you join the corporate world, you become a number. At least, that is what
I heard - and believed. The corporate game involves a lot of players and you
need to play or get out. What is a number anyway? Someone who is not heard or
who's opinion is simply ignored?

If that is the case, I don't want to be a number. I have opinions and
ideas that I like to share. I have skills that I can use to contribute to
different areas in the software development lifecycle. I don't want to settle
to do meaningless tasks for a paycheck. I want to contribute.

## Losing your identity
After eight years of working for small to medium businesses, I joined a
company that contracted me out to a corporate. I was overwhelmed. There were
so many people, technologies that I never even heard of and processes I needed
to figure out. I was *really* overwhelmed.

People knew who I was at my previous companies. In this new world I was
completely out of my comfort zone. I didn't mind though. It makes me feel alive
even though it is very uncomfortable.

## Creating your identity
With time and a personal investment in building relationships across the business
I was able to shine bright like that diamond Rhianna sings about. I was getting
exposed to all sorts of people in the organization. People call me by my name.

I may be a number to the layers above me but I don't feel like a number. My
managers always listen to me, care about my adjustments, environment and
well-being. I often find myself having insightful conversations with the heads
or development leads of our division. At the end of the day, you are working
with people.

If you are considering joining a corporate and are worried about being a number,
just remember that it is in your control. If you want to be a number, you will
be. If you don't, get out of your comfort zone and start talking.
Build relationships. You learn so much just by talking to other people and
corporates tend to have a lot of people.
