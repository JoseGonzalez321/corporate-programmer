Now that I beat you to it with the Hannibal reference, I'd like to officially
introduce myself.

My name is Clarice and I have been a software developer for... many years now. I
started out in high school. Development is my passion.

For most of my career I have worked in small to medium companies. I started at
a corporate in 2014 and it has changed my life.

I am not advocating that everyone should start working at one but it does come
with a large list of pros and cons. Please tell me if I am wrong but this is
true for any job opportunity. No company, place or person is perfect.

The transition into the corporate was a culture shock for me. I went through a
lot of unnecessary frustrations. I came to many fascinating realizations.

I'd like to share what I have learned - and still learning - about how to
survive the transition from small to big. A survival guide of sorts.

Feel free to get in touch with me. I am most active on
[Twitter](http://www.twitter.com/cbillowes) (@cbillowes).

I hope you enjoy this journey with me.
