views of my employer.

My name is Clarice Bouwer and I am a software developer.
I officially started my [career](/timeline) in 2006. I now work as a Software
Developer at [DStv Digital Media](http://dstvdm.dstv.com/).

## Background

I like to believe that I have strong technical skills within
the web space from front-end to back-end. Some days imposter syndrome kicks in
badly.

I've mainly been working in the .NET stack
but I like dabbling with all sorts of languages, libraries and technologies.
I also have a passion for UX and design which is why I chose to design my own
blog. You can checkout the
[GitHub repository](https://github.com/cbillowes/corporate-programmer) if you like.
Feel free to share any tips or tricks with me.

## How I started this blog

I've worked in small to medium sized companies for a large chunk of my career.
When I joined a corporate in 2014 the transition was overwhelming.
It changed my life by introducing me to the development community and
offered me an array of perspectives.

I've made many mistakes in my career and I have learned to find
opportunities from them and then
[wrote](/blog/how-i-got-an-article-published) about it.

I am not advocating that everyone should start working at a corporate but
this is how my career officially became a journey.

For every negative experience I encounter, I like to extract learning points.
This is what I want to share on Corporate Programmer - a survival guide of
sorts. I don't always get it write but when I do I hope it proves useful to you.

I hope you enjoy this journey with me.

P.S. I need to admit that I don't actually wear glasses. This photo was taken for fun
at work when Harvey Specter came to visit our offices at MultiChoice as he was
announced as [DStv Premium's official ambassador](http://ewn.co.za/2015/08/31/Harvey-Specter-announced-as-DSTV-Premiums-official-ambassador).
