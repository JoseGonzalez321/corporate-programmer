Now that I beat you to it with the Hannibal reference, I'd like to officially
introduce myself.

My name is Clarice Bouwer and I have been a software developer for... many years now. I
started out in high school. Development is my passion.

For most of my career I have worked in small to medium companies. I started at
a corporate in 2014 and it has changed my life.

I am not advocating that everyone should start working at one but it does come
many pros (and cons). Correct me if I am wrong but this is
true for any job opportunity. No company, place or person is perfect.

The transition into the corporate world was a culture shock for me. With every
frustration I encounter, there is a fascinating realization.

I'd like to share what I have learned - and still am learning - about how to
survive the corporate world - a survival guide of sorts.

I hope you enjoy this journey with me.

at work when Harvey Specter came to visit our offices at MultiChoice as he was
announced as [DStv Premium's official ambassador](http://ewn.co.za/2015/08/31/Harvey-Specter-announced-as-DSTV-Premiums-official-ambassador).
