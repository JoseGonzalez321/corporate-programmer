views of my employer.

My name is Clarice Bouwer and I have been a software developer for a long time.
I officially started my career in 2006. I have strong technical skills within
the web space from front-end to back-end. I've mainly been in the .NET space
but I love dabbling with all sorts of languages, libraries and technologies.
I also like making things look pretty.

I've worked in small to medium sized companies for a large chunk of my career.
When I joined a corporate in 2014 the transition was rather overwhelming.
It changed my life by introducing me to the development community and
offered me an array of perspectives.

I am not advocating that everyone should start working at a corporate but
this is how my career officially became a journey.

For every negative experience I encounter, I like to extract learning points.
This is what I want to share on { corporate <strong>programmer</strong> } -
a survival guide of sorts.

I hope you enjoy this journey with me.

P.S. I need to admit that I don't actually wear glasses. This photo was taken for fun
at work when Harvey Specter came to visit our offices at MultiChoice as he was
announced as [DStv Premium's official ambassador](http://ewn.co.za/2015/08/31/Harvey-Specter-announced-as-DSTV-Premiums-official-ambassador).
