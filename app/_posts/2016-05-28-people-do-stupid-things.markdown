  We are human. It's what we do.

People are going to do stupid things. Whether they do it intentionally or not.
It's guaranteed to happen at least once a day and there's no way to control it.

When you are working at a corporate, you will be surrounded by stupid shit. It
could make your head explode. Luckily there is a balance of some sort.

I keep reiterating that we are all human, we all make mistakes and we all have
subjective perspectives but it doesn't mean that when people do stupid
things that I am happy about it. It's actually frustrating.

I tend to have high expectations; a disadvantage of being a millennial.
It makes it hard to deal with what I perceive to be inconsiderate behavior and
bad work etiquette.

The keyword here is perceive and it's **my perception**. Not everyone is going
to perceive it in the same light.
