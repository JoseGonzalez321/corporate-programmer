  We are human. It's what we do.

People do stupid things. It's guaranteed and there's no way to control it.
That's what makes [epic fail videos](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=epic+failes)
so popular.

While we aren't failing on such epic proportions in our professional capacity,
we are still surrounded by a lot of stupid things that collectively make up our
days. Like it or not, everyone contributes.

I keep saying that we are all human, we all make mistakes and we all have
subjective perspectives. I know this. But it doesn't mean that it doesn't
get frustrating.

## Lower expectations
Unfortunately I have exceptionally high expectations; a disadvantage of being a
[millennial or Generation Y](http://www.consultancy.uk/news/2061/generation-y-less-satisfied-than-other-generations).
It makes it hard for me to deal with what I perceive to be
inconsiderate behavior and bad work etiquette.

It gets exhausting to try be patient and stay understanding. I need to lower
my expectations. Bring it closer to reality without negatively
impacting me. I don't know how to do this entirely but I know that I need to
stop chasing [unicorns](/blog/the-perfect-illusion/).

  behind why Generation Y yuppies are unhappy.

## Accept the reality
I kept trying to find ways to completely eliminate pain in our team. Then
someone told me that although pain can be minimized it can never be eliminated.

This shift in mindset took boulders off my shoulders. My goal would never
be reached so I need to aim lower.

The reality of our existence is that there will always be stupid shit happening
around us. We are married to it until death do us part. We need to accept it
and find better ways to deal with it.

### Highlight frustrations
What I have found interesting is that I'd often let frustrations build up.
This in itself is stupid. All it takes is a conversation with the person in
question. Often uncomfortable but such to be had. If it doesn't work, escalate.

This is simple right? Not for me. I didn't even see it until it was brought to
my attention.

### Get the right people talking
I was getting worked up because people weren't talking to each other. Maybe they
were but they weren't all on the same page. Then someone told me if everyone
talks to each other all the time, no one would be able to do any work. We need
the right people to talk to the right people.

Hmmm. I accept that, especially in large organizations. So who are the right
people? We can start where we have control and try branch out to find the
right people to give us the answers we are searching for.

* What information does the team need in order to maintain their product and
  create new features?
* What information does the team need to make sure all aspects of their product
  is working (monitoring and health checks)?
* What would a new person need to get started in the team?
* What keeps impeding work from getting done?

### Highlight team dysfunction
Another stupid thing I find myself doing is fulfilling other roles when there
is a gap. I'm naturally cross-functional and can slot in anywhere:
Process &rarr; UX &rarr; Design &rarr; Frontend &rarr; Backend &rarr;
DevOps &rarr; Technical Support.

I don't see anything wrong with being able to do this but when it causes extra
overhead which impedes my duties and the business is not aware of it, it hides
the fact that there is an underlying problem.

* Do we have a shortage of professionals in the team?
* Are the professionals in the team actually doing their work?
* Are the professionals in the team being asked to do work elsewhere?
* Do we have professionals with the right skills in the team?
* Are the professionals in the team the appropriate fit culturally?

### Find a mentor
Being a human being is complicated. We are tangled with all sorts of
psychological behaviors and we are all different. It's interesting to see how
we are shaped by our experiences as we age.

If you can find someone who doesn't share the same mindset as you, you can
extract valuable insights through conversation which can help you deal with
frustrations better.

that "sometimes we do things that seem really stupid at the time but that turn
out to be smart moves in the long run."

I guess we could just find better ways of dealing with such issues and
continuously improve ourselves. Be the change we want to see.
