<h1><code>500 Server Error</code></h1>
<p>
  This is serious. Things went pear-shaped on the server. Perhaps the administrator set
  something that should not have been set. One can only hope it's versioned.
  Sorry about this!

  Sadly, the administrator will not know that you are seeing this.
  You can send a notification to <a href="mailto:{{site.email}}">{{site.email}}</a>.
