I first heard of about Iris while listening to an episode of
[Hansleminutes](http://hanselminutes.com/331/starting-programming-with-iris-classon).
Naturally I [Googled](https://www.google.co.za/search?q=iris+classon&oq=iris+classon) her.
This woman is amazing!

Like most developers, she followed her passion. Except she did so shortly after
she got her degree to become a registered dietitian.

> My background is in the nutrition, fitness and private healthcare industry
and I am a nutritionist, registered dietitian and international licensed
personal trainer and instructor. A year ago I made a drastic career change
and started studying programming, and I have never looked back. ~ Iris during
and [interview](http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/449553/A-Coder-Interview-With-Iris-Classon)
at CodeProject.

In August 2011 she started [studying](http://irisclasson.com/2012/07/13/my-first-year-of-programming-july-11-2011-july-12-2012/)
and since then she has accomplished more than what some developers can only
dream of.

She studied hard, asked a lot of questions, pursued her Microsoft certifications
and became a Microsoft Most Valuable Professional. The biggest take away for me
out of all her accomplishments is that she was active in the community from
her first day. This is how she has contributed:

## Blogging
She was blogging long before she was programming but when she started she
adjusted her posts to be more technical.

* She **documented** her experience: what she learned and how it made her feel.
* She started a series of ["stupid" questions](http://irisclasson.com/2012/07/17/asking-a-stupid-question-every-day-for-365-days/)
  so that she could learn something new each day.

## Meetups & Hackathons

## Social Media

## Author

## Speaker

## Interviews


She is a [blogging](http://getupandcode.com/2013/05/05/ask-iris-to-blog-or-not-to-blog-and-what-if-you-are-a-junior-developer/)
natural and posted frequently. When she started studying programming her
posts became more technical. She **documented** everything she was learning.
A year into her studies she started asking a
["stupid" question](http://irisclasson.com/2012/07/17/asking-a-stupid-question-every-day-for-365-days/)
so that she could learn something new each day.




She has so much energy. This ties into her passion and you can see it as she is

Her passion, energy, charisma, humility and drive in the software development community
